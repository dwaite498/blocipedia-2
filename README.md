# Blocipedia

This is a wiki collaboration project that allows users to create short wiki's and collaborate with eachother to make sure the inidividual entries are accurate.
Upon registration with a free account, users are able to see all public wiki's and may edit any of the entries they can see. Once a user upgrades
their account, they may make private wiki's that are visible only to them and those who they choose to be collaborators.
